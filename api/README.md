So the API isn't just going to be an API. I want to have some SSR of elements. I also want the server to handle routing (I think)

# Site plan
Assume user has account
## Home 
Would be the home for the user

Each main page is a component that is rendered in the frontend.
For example the "/profile/user123" endpoint would render the profile component in the frontend which would fetch the information for user123 from the backend.
