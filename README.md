# Citation Manager
Citation manager allows you to manage the research sources for your projects.

# Todo:
## API
- Have tokens stored in the db so that if a new token has been issues the old tokens, despite not being expired, are no longer valid.
- Create the api routes for fetching, updating, etc projects and citations.
- Citations first.
- somehow have to handle people being able to view the projects with a permalink? Actually no, private only 
- Projects should record the order of the citations

## Front End
- All of it lmao
